          <h3>My favorite color</h3>
          <p>
         I have tons of favorite colors, but if I had to pick I would have to pick blue just like every other 12 year old boy. This is everywhere like the sky. The sky reminds me of freedom and this is why blue is my favorite color.

          <h3>My favorite food</h3>
          <p>Food is essential for life. Most food we eat are mostly for the taste not for fullfillment like when Donald Trump orders 10 Big Macs for every single meal of his he does this cause he likes the taste not because it fullfills him the most. So most people have their best tasting food just like how Donald Trump has his Big Macs. Well my favorite food isn't really a food but a dessert. My favorite food is Icecream. Who doesn't like icecream? Icecream is the most common dessert to eat across america. Icecream comes im many flavors so if you don't like chocolate you can get strawberry if you don't like chocolate of strawberry you get vanilla Icecream.</p>
